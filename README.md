# Programming-Project-3

The goal of this program is to create a functional game of Battleship to be played against a computer opponent.
This program will allow users to manually position their ships on a grid using the arrow and enter keys.
It will also show both the users' grid and the opponent's grid, the user's and opponent's remaining boats, and
the number of hits each boat has left.
The user will be able to select which cell to attack by inputting the cell's coordinates.
The program will end once either player's fleet has sunk.
